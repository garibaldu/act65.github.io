Money - what is it really? I know I don't know, but I'm not able to articulate why I don't know. This is a struggle.

Cooperation, power. Can't we all just get along? No. So what to do. I'm interested in the micro-structure of force / negotiation. Where one ends and the other begins. Morality from Bellman. Going and figuring.
